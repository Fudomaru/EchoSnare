# ESP32-S3 Projekt

## Why?

I don't think I really need an reason except 
that learning is fun, and if i really want to 
understand Software, Infrastructure, Tools, and everything in btween, 
I have to work with some hardware I can configure from the core up. 

After looking around, my decision went to the ESP32. 
And that is the whole reason. 

## What? 

Here is a link to my first general thoughts of what I am trying to build:

[EchoSnare](https://voidex.me/projects/echosnare/)

In general I decided to try to build a WifiSniffer
and see what happens. 
My hope is that I will learn a lot about 
how our wireless networks actually works, what you can do with it,
and especially important for me: 
What Security with networks over the air really means. 

## Conclusion

Work in porgress.
